            Hybrid text summarization is an approach that combines multiple
            techniques or methods to generate concise summaries of text
            documents. This method leverages the strengths of different
            summarization approaches, such as extractive and abstractive
            summarization, to produce more accurate and informative
            summaries.<br />
          </p>
          <p>
            In hybrid text summarization, extractive techniques involve
            selecting important sentences or phrases directly from the original
            text, usually based on criteria like relevance or importance scores
            computed using algorithms. These techniques are efficient and
            preserve the original wording, but they may not always capture the
            essence of the content effectively. On the other hand, abstractive
            techniques involve generating summaries by paraphrasing and
            rephrasing the original text, potentially introducing new words and
            sentence structures. Abstractive summarization can produce more
            human-like summaries and capture the main ideas more effectively,
            but it is often more challenging and requires advanced natural
            language understanding and generation capabilities.

            By combining extractive and abstractive approaches, hybrid text
            summarization aims to overcome the limitations of each method while
            benefiting from their respective strengths. For instance, extractive
            methods can be used to identify important sentences or phrases,
            which are then rephrased or synthesized using abstractive techniques
            to create more coherent and informative summaries. Overall, hybrid
            text summarization offers a flexible and powerful approach to
            summarizing text documents, allowing for more accurate and
            comprehensive summaries that better capture the essence of the
            original content.
